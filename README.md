TOPIC: ADVANCED DISK SCHEDULING SIMULATOR

Overview:
The Advanced Disk Scheduling Simulator is a software tool designed to simulate various disk scheduling algorithms. These algorithms help manage how disk requests are processed efficiently, minimizing seek time and optimizing overall system performance.


The simulator provides implementations for multiple scheduling techniques, including:
FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)
SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)
SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)
C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)
LOOK
C-LOOK (Circular LOOK)


Problem Statement:
Efficient disk scheduling is critical for optimizing disk performance in operating systems. Different scheduling algorithms impact seek time, latency, and overall efficiency. Without a proper simulation tool, students and researchers struggle to understand and compare these algorithms. This project aims to develop a disk scheduling simulator that implements FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, LOOK, and C-LOOK, allowing users to visualize disk movements, compare algorithm efficiency, and analyse seek time performance interactively.
Solution -
A Python-based interactive simulator that takes user input for disk requests, applies multiple scheduling algorithms, and provides graphical visualizations and performance analysis.
